Project Instructions

Download and unzip animal-trading-cards.zip from the downloadables section. Inside, you'll find card.html, styles.css, clownfish.jpg, and the design-prototype.pdf.
Next, add the proper CSS to styles.css to recreate the design prototype. Youâ€™ll need to modify card.html to include attributes and use selectors to specify the elements you want to style. Also, make sure to link to your stylesheet in card.html or else your CSS will not be applied to your webpage.
The CSS should apply these styles to match the design prototype:
italicized text for the animal's interesting fact
bolded labels for the animal's list items (e.g. 'Habitat')
border around the animal's name, image, and information
border around the animal's information
spacing between the animal's name, image, and information (you will need to use the property padding)
